# BullMQ demonstration

## Instructions

(after cloning the repository)

0. Make sure you have the correct NodeJS version. I'm using `v23.10.0` and ASDF to manage NodeJS versions. If you are as well, you can use the following command to install the correct version:

```bash
asdf install
```

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the server:

```bash
npm start
```
